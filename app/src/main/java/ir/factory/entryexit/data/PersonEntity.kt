/**
 * A registered person / machine / driver / visitor.
 *
 * [id] is the Firestore document ID (shared across every guard's phone and the web panel) —
 * Room's @PrimaryKey here is just that same string, not a locally auto-generated number, so
 * IDs never collide between devices writing at the same time.
 * [isInside] is the single source of truth for whether they are currently inside the factory.
 * [group] is a department name for personnel, or a fleet/model group for machinery.
 * [imageUri] is a LOCAL content:// URI (profile photos are not currently synced to the cloud —
 * see README for why — so each device shows its own locally-assigned photos only).
 * [lastEventAt] is updated on every check-in/out and used to sort "currently inside" lists.
 * [isBlacklisted] blocks future check-ins for this person/machine.
 * [insideParking] is MACHINERY-only: whether the vehicle is currently inside the *internal
 * parking area* specifically, tracked completely independently of [isInside]. A vehicle can be
 * inside the factory ([isInside] = true) but out of parking ([insideParking] = false) — e.g.
 * moved to the in-house repair shop or taken out for photos — without ever crossing the main
 * gate, so the parking guard needs its own status to check it out/in for that, separate from
 * whatever the gate guard has recorded. No @PropertyName needed here (unlike [isInside]) since
 * this name doesn't start with "is", so Firestore's Java SDK doesn't strip anything from it.
 *
 * NOTE: [isInside]/[isBlacklisted] are explicitly pinned to their exact Firestore field names
 * via @PropertyName. Without this, Firestore's Java/Android SDK silently strips the "is" prefix
 * from boolean getters (isInside() -> field "inside") when serializing via .set(entity), which
 * would then mismatch the literal "isInside" key used by Repository's raw .update(mapOf(...))
 * calls — two different keys for the same logical field, silently breaking status sync.
